> The project is a simple SPA, that imitates flight tickets search. Besides the basic tasks, I made many improvements to the app, such as:
> - responsive design,
> - infinite scroll & lazy loading,
> - tickets counter,
> - error notifications.    
>
> You can find the original test assignment [on this page](https://github.com/KosyanMedia/test-tasks/tree/master/aviasales_frontend) (in russian).
